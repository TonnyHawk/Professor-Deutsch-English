# Professor Deutsch&English
 Language school website

## Project description  
Site was ordered by the language school "Professor Deutsch & English". The task was to present the school in general and each of it`s department separately (German and english). The owners and main teachers here are a married couple that shares the same ideas and approaches to the learning process so it was decided to use the same design and main page structure for both and mix common content (main school ideas, history, description) with a specific to each separate department (students, awards, teachers..)  
## Task realization  
### Main idea
It was important to present separate teachers, students and their awards for each independent school department. The owner also wanted to have ability to change the site`s content in the future by himself, so it was decided to combine the static content (common for both schools) with dynamically generated one. According to that idea i made a project structure that looks like this  
  
### Project structure
+ Intro (static) - user can choose the school
+ Main page (static / dynamic)
+ Gallery (dynamic) - shows all media content like school gallery, student portfolios, awards and certificates
